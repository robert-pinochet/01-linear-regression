A simple project while iÂ´m studying linear regression analysis with the babies dataset from kaggle. 

About Babies Dataset: The dataset provides information on a child's weight at birth plus some stats on the child's mother: is she a smoker or not, her height, her weight, the gestation length, and so on.
